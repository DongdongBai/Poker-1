    An equity distribution is a histogram that looks like this:

    Effectively, this algorithm finds out how many opponent hands give it a given
    amount of equity for various levels of equity from 0 to 1. This distributon
    can then be used to compare hand similarity, which is a more effective
    measurement than expectation because hands like 6c6d have similar expected
    equity to QsJs, but have very different equity distributions.

    Inputs:
        preflop - The player's preflop holdings
        flop - Flop cards on the board
        turn - Turn card
        equity_bins - Number of bins the histogram should use. Effectively this
            represents the number of discrete equity levels that values get
            rounded to.
        opponent_samples - How many random opponent holdings to deal.
        rollout_samples - How many times to run the rollouts (deal the rest of
            the hand) for each opponent sample
